# Code Quiz

This CodeQuiz is a fun way to test your coding knowledge!  Here's how it works:

From the home page, the user has an option to click a button to "Start Quiz".

Upon clicking the button, the timer begins at 100 seconds and the user is presented with a series of questions. 

The user's score is dependant upon how quickly they're able to correctly complete the questions.  Time remaining on the clock becomes the user's score.  Answer quickly and correctly, you might just get a high score! Answer incorrectly, ouch!  Brace yourself for a time penalty (15 seconds are subtracted from time remaining).  User will be prompted to enter initials; high score and initials saved to local storage and visible in console log.  I'm working on getting these to display to the browser but am submitting what I have so far.
